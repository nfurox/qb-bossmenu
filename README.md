# qb-bossmenu
New bossmenu converted to qb-menu and qb-input.
qb-bossmenu and qb-gangmenu converted to qb-menu, merged into a single resource, and saves the account in the database.
I have converted the function that looks for server-side players, so that I can have more information about the players nearby.
I rewrote most of the events.
if there are any problems or other, do not hesitate to contact me or to open a pool request
